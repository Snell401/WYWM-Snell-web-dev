### Make a Cocktail API app that iterates through the object and returns random drinks or returns drinks based on a simple input. 


## Features we want to achieve:

- User's can add their own cocktail recipes (where do we store it???)
  - start with ***local storage***
- Every user can access it too

- User can add ingredients they own to their 'bar'
- can click on ingredient(s) to search recipes
  - filter filter filter!
- 'highlight' the missing ingredients
